        <p>Peter Gene Hernandez (born October 8, 1985 in Waikiki, Hawaii), better known by his stage name Bruno Mars, is a Filipino-Puerto Rican American singer-songwriter, producer and musician signed to Atlantic Records. He has released three studio albums: Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010, #3 USA), Unorthodox Jukebox (2012, #1 USA), and 24K Magic (2016, #2 USA). As of 2018, Mars has ten top 10 hits in the USA (and five more as a featured artist), including seven #1 singles combined : “Just the Way You Are”, “Grenade”, “Locked Out of Heaven”, “When I Was Your Man”, “That’s What I Like”, “Uptown Funk” by Mark Ronson and “Nothin’ On You” by B.o.B. Mars has won 11 Grammy Awards in his career.</p>
        <p>Bruno Mars was born and raised in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii by parents Pete and Bernadette “Bernie” Hernandez, of Puerto Rican and Filipino descent. Hernandez was one of six children and came from a musical family giving him a diverse mix of reggae, rock, hip hop, and R&B. From a young age, he was impersonating and performing songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, The Isley Brothers, and The Temptations. In 1990, Hernandez was featured in MidWeek as “Little Elvis”, going on to have a cameo in Honeymoon in Vegas in 1992. “I watch the best. I’m a big fan of Elvis. I’m a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It’s just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love studying them because I’m a fan,” he stated.</p>
        <p>In 2010 he said, “Growing up in Hawaii made me the man I am. I used to do a lot of shows in Hawaii with my father’s band. Everybody in my family sings, everyone plays instruments. My uncle’s an incredible guitar player, my dad’s an incredible percussionist, my brother’s a great drummer, he actually plays in our band. I’ve just been surrounded by it.” He attended President Theodore Roosevelt High School, graduating in 2003 at the age of seventeen, and shortly after moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue a musical career.</p>
